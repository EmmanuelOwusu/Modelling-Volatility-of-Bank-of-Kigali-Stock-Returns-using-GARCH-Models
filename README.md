####  SUMMARY 

This study models the volatility of the Bank of Kigali (BK) using the GARCH(1,1)
model on daily stock prices from the Rwanda Stock Exchange between 2012 and 2017.
Missing data were imputed using the Kalman filtering method. Two GARCH(1,1)
models were compared, with the stationary alternative model being preferred. The
results show volatility clustering and persistence in BK stock returns, suggesting
that the alternative GARCH(1,1) model is more suitable for modeling volatility in
emerging markets.
